I'm Jonas, software engineer apprentice from someplace in Denmark.

I'm a big fan of JavaScript (even though it's trash ðŸ˜‰) and wish to learn and git gud with TypeScript, so that's what you'll primarily see on here.
I also use this account for school, so my school projects will be saved on here too!
