<h2>Hello there!</h2>

<!--â™¥â™¥â™¥ ![Vue.js](https://img.shields.io/badge/vuejs-%2335495e.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=vuedotjs&logoColor=%234FC08D) â™¥â™¥â™¥ -->

I'm Jonas, software engineer apprentice from someplace in Denmark but moved to Switzerland.

I'm a big fan of JavaScript (TypeScript FTW tho), so that's what you'll primarily see on here.
I also use this account for school, so my school projects will be saved on here too!
